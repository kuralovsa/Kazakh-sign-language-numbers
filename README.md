Relevance of the research topic. And every time there was an indistinguishable particle of people's relationships with each other. In addition, it is a convenient tool for communicating with a computer.
Ymdar offers an interesting paradigm of interaction in various computer programs. The importance of gesture recognition lies in the formation of effective human-machine interaction. The problems associated with these recognition methods are the technology used to collect raw body movement data. There are usually two types of technologies for collecting this data. The first is a glove insertion device that measures the number of joints in the hand. The accuracy of the glove insertion device depends on the type of flexible sensor technology used; as a rule, the more specific the gloves, the more expensive they are. The second way to collect raw data is computer vision. If computer vision-based solutions can overcome some difficulties and disadvantages, they are the best choice for collecting raw data. There are several recognition methods, such as object identification, object acquisition, and active form templates.
Technology is a key factor enabling people with disabilities to make decisions to improve the quality of life, and hence the ability of a machine to understand human movements, interpret the intentions of a deaf person and react accordingly, which is one of the most important aspects of human-machine interaction (HMI). In addition, gesture recognition is a very difficult task not only because of the variety of contexts, multiple interpretations, spatio-temporal variations, complex non-strict properties of the hand, but also because of the different levels of illumination and complex background. Attempts to teach various systems to see and understand the world as a person began decades ago, but now these technologies are being improved so much and are actively used in many areas of our life. Unfortunately, many of the systems studied in this work are designed to work only in special conditions with limited movement.
The Python programming language was chosen to implement such a project. Python is a modern language that has many advantages over other competitors. In particular, to implement this project, there is an OPENCV and OS library that works directly with the system, without installing unnecessary utilities. 
OpenCV (English: Open Source Computer Vision Library, open source computer vision Library) is a library of computer vision algorithms, image processing and general-purpose open-source digital algorithms. The presence of such a library allows us to overcome the difficulties of studying the code recognition of certain objects. Like these components of the code, our project helps society to go beyond the limits of possibilities.

After detecting the palm on the entire image, our subsequent model of the hand landmark accurately localizes the key points of the 21 three-dimensional coordinates of the hand inside the detected areas of the hand by regression, that is, direct prediction of coordinates. The model learns a consistent internal representation of the hand pose and is resistant even to partially visible hands and self-occlusions.
To get ground data, we manually annotated ~30,000 real-world images with 21 three-dimensional coordinates, as shown below (we take the Z-value from the image depth map if it exists for the corresponding coordinate). In order to better cover possible hand poses and provide additional observation of the nature of the geometry of the hands, we also visualize a high-quality synthetic model of the hand on various backgrounds and match it with the corresponding 3D coordinates.
